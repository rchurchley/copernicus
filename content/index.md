# Copernicus

Copernicus is a website theme intended for long-form writing and professional portfolios. Although it began as a WordPress theme, it has been reimplemented as a basic `nanoc` site.

# Installation

1. Download, clone, or fork this project.
2. Install [`nanoc`](http://nanoc.ws) and Copernicus' gem dependencies: `redcarpet` and `sass`
3. Update `nanoc.yaml` with your site's settings.
4. Run `nanoc` on your site's root folder.
