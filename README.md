Copernicus
==========

Copernicus is a flexible, lightweight WordPress theme intended for long-form writing and professional portfolios. It features custom fields for source attribution, style support for footnotes (enabled by plugin), human-readable HTML5 source code, and the total absence of comments.

Support Disclaimer
------------------

I do not provide any form of support for this theme. In fact, I don't even recommend you rely on Copernicus out-of-the-box for your own website: I develop it primarily for my own purposes, so its design and codebase are subject to change with my personal whims and circumstances.

Installation
------------

1. Install [WordPress][WP].
2. Download the files and add them to `/wp-content/themes/copernicus/`
3. Activate the Copernicus theme in Dashboard > Appearance.

If you intend to use Copernicus for your own website, I highly recommend you fork the project. (I have a tendency to make major design changes from time to time.)
