# Copernicus

Copernicus is a SCSS theme to bootstrap your way to a simple, attractive, mobile-friendly website.


## Modifications

The colour scheme can be tweaked by changing the constants defined at the top of `source/colour.scss`. Site-specific styles should be added to the bottom of `source/main.scss` and `source/colour.scss`.


## Installation

1. Download, clone, or fork this project.
2. Compile the styles with `sass --scss --update source:copernicus`.
3. Link to the compiled stylesheets from any webpage following the structure sketched in `template.haml`.
