Copernicus
==========

A simple, responsive WordPress theme. It has a simple aesthetic that extends right down to the HTML source.

Although Copernicus is stable enough to power at least one live site — my own — it is far from polished. It's my first serious project in PHP (WordPress API or no), so it almost certainly contains bugs and/or code I will feel embarassed about in a few months. I cannot recommend its deployment in the wild unless you A) are very foolhardy or B) have examined the code yourself.

I don't offer support for this and take no responsibility for any problems it may cause.
